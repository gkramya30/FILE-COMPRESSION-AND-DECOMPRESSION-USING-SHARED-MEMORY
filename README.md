“FILE COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION WITH SHARED MEMORY”, I have tried to show how this technique used to reduce the size of files by removing redundant information and storing them in a compressed format.
This technique utilizes shared memory, which is a memory space that can be accessed by multiple processes simultaneously.
